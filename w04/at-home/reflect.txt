In this lab we were introduced to array. Arrays are collection of types of data
and it is very useful for storing and sorting information. Instead of relying on just on
variable we can store multiple sets of data in the array. E.g int ar[4] = {1,2,3,4}
Array become very useful when I was storing sorted information, you can easily use a for-loop
and manipulate or print the content of the array on the the console

What I learned is that array is a collection of pointers to the memory where the value is stored.
Overall array allows programmers to program more efficiently and organize data easily.

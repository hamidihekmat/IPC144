This lab was quite challenging, this is not a bad thing but actually a good thing. This lab thought
me how to think differently and come up with a different approach of solving the problem.
In this lab we were introduced to struct. What is struct?
In simplest term struct is away to store sets of different data type. OR an 'object'.

Structs can be used to write cleaner code and store info into struct array and keep everything organized.
This is really useful since C is not a OOP. At least now programers can have a way of storing data into
C objects (structs).

Overall this lab was very 'heavy' and I learned a lot from it.

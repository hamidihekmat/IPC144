In this milestone, I learned how to get "string" input from the console and store it into an struct object.
C uses a needs to allocate spaces in an array for each characters. C also needs to ignore the end of the line
"\n" from the input. This is kind of confusing at first but you eventually get used it.
Using this method can make a program very secure since we know which data type we are exactly accepting.

The best practice to store string in an array properly is first we need to identify the size of the data we want
to store. For example, let's say we want to gather the user's phone number. We will have to allocate at least 11 spaces
in an array since the last index is used to store "\0" which implies that the string has ended.

String allows us to create more complex programs that will be very useful ecommerce and other types of tasks.

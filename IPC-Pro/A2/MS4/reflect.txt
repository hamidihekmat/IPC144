This milestone was very function heavy, I learned to use and create different
functions that would also be helper functions for other functions. 
For example I used the findContactIndex function for many of my other functions
such as updateContact and etc.
Re-suing function can make save you lots of time, you don't really need to code
again and again, you can simply just think about the purpuse of the functiona
and reuse it as you wish.

I think this would be a great program if we had the option of saving the contacts in to a text file or more like a database. This way the contacts actually save and we dont have to keep re-entering the data.

So far this assignemnt was the toughest since you had to track every function 
and try to find and fix bugs in the program. But, the most annoying thing is fixing the output error. My program was working but I had issues with spacing which
took me hours to fix. Many students are frustrated by this. I wish there was
a way to only check the function itself and analyse the output instead of 
cheking all the output at once.

This milestone was pretty buggy for me. I got the idea of seperating each individual component of the program into different modules so it can easily be access within one file "a2m2.c". But I had to some issues running this code. After restarting my PC it seemed to work.

SO far this milestone thought me some techniques on how to find bugs within my code. I created a different project and I tested each functions to see if there were any bugs within the program. This method really helped me understand how find and fix bugs.
